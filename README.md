**Sales Prediction using Python**

**Overview**
This project predicts future sales based on advertising spend across **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper** platforms. It uses **machine learning regression models** to analyse how changes in advertising investment impact sales, helping businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

**Objectives**
- Predict future sales based on advertising spend and platform.  
- Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.  
- Apply regression and ensemble models for forecasting.  
- Evaluate model accuracy using key performance metrics.  
- Derive actionable insights for marketing strategies.

**Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

**Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing and unwanted columns  
   - Performed correlation analysis  

2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared models using **R²**, **RMSE**, and **MAE**

4. **Insights Generation**
   - Analysed the effect of 10% increased advertising budget  
   - Identified the most influential advertising medium  


**Results**
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **R² Score:** 0.98  
- **Insight:** TV and Radio investments show the strongest impact on sales growth.

**Key Learnings**
- Data preprocessing and feature selection significantly improve prediction accuracy.  
- Ensemble methods outperform simple regression for complex datasets.  
- Visual analytics enhance interpretability of marketing data.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **machine learning can forecast sales trends** and guide businesses to optimise advertising budgets for maximum revenue impact.
